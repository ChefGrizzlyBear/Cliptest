Explanation and Crucial Considerations:
 * document.execCommand('paste'):
   * This is the only way to attempt to get clipboard content without the Clipboard API.
   * It's important to understand that execCommand('paste') has significant limitations and is generally considered unreliable.
   * It is often blocked by browser security.
 * Temporary Textarea:
   * A temporary textarea element is created and added to the DOM.
   * tempInput.select() selects the textarea, which is necessary for execCommand('paste') to work.
   * After the paste operation, the textarea is removed from the DOM.
 * Error Handling:
   * A try...catch block handles potential errors.
   * A message is displayed in the pasteTarget div to indicate the result of the paste operation.
   * Error messages are logged to the console.
 * Security Risks and Limitations:
   * execCommand('paste') is heavily restricted for security reasons. Browsers often block it, especially if the user hasn't explicitly granted permission.
   * It might not work reliably across different browsers or operating systems.
   * This method is also being phased out, and is not recommended.
 * User Interaction:
   * The paste operation is triggered by a button click, which is essential for security.
 * No permissions requests:
   * This method will not trigger any permissions requests. Due to the security concerns, most browsers will block the paste command without explicit user interaction within the browser itself.
In summary:
 * This code provides a way to attempt to get clipboard content without the Clipboard API, but it's not a reliable or recommended approach.
 * The Clipboard API is the modern and secure way to access the clipboard.
